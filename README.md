Secure Private Messaging
Using blockchain to secure private information exchanged in chats, messaging apps and through social media. Unlike the end-to-end encryption employed by the likes of WhatsApp , this messenger will use blockchain to secure users' metadata. The user will not have to use email or any other authentication method to use the messenger. It will be p2p based.
